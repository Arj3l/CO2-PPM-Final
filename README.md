# CO2 PPM - Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide

How CO2 Level in Hawaii have increased over the years?

## Dataset Description

The dataset was gathered in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Each month per year, new data is being added. The rows of the dataset are Date, Decimal Date, Average, Interpolated, Trend, Number of Days and __parsed_extra

## Summary of Findings

Based from the dataset, the CO2 level in Mauna Loa, Hawaii is constantly since 1958. From 315.71 in March 1958, the CO2 (PPM) have increased to 422.99 in August 2024.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Visualization

![CO2 Levels Overtime](plot-img/CO2-Overtime.png)
The line graph shows that the CO2 levels have consistently increasing. This upward trend indicates a signifiicant acceleration in atmospheric CO2 concentrations that is likely driven by human activities. The sharp rise in CO2 levels poses a critical challenge for global climate stability.
